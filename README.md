# 📊 Student Exam Score Prediction – ML Deployment Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model into a production-like environment using **Streamlit** and **Docker**. The deployed application allows users to input student-related features through a web-based interface and receive a predicted exam score generated by a trained machine learning pipeline.

The goal of this project is to show the **end-to-end process** of:
- Loading a trained ML model
- Providing a user-facing interface for interaction
- Deploying the system in a reproducible environment
- Documenting the installation and usage process


# Summary
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning deployment workflow, including:
- Model loading and inference
- Interactive user interface design
- Containerized deployment
- Clear installation and usage documentation

The model itself is an ElasticNet-Direct regression model, the pipeline for which is included within the project file structure. 
The model is trained, based on a handful of features that you'd imagine (e.g. hours slept, hours spent studying, etc.). 
Below are the final test metrics for the version of the model that is being used:
- R2: 0.7291
- Adj. R2: 0.7249
- RMSE: 9.7458
- MAE: 7.8040

## Model Description

- **Goal:** Predict a given student’s exam score (%)
- **Inputs:**
  - 11 features total
    - Numeric features (e.g., age, study hours, sleep hours, attendance rate)
    - Categorical features (e.g., gender, course, study method, exam difficulty)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Numerical features are standardized with the StandardScaler
  - Categorical features are one-hot encoded
  - Additional interaction features are generated
- **Model:** ElasticaNet-Direct regression model
- **Pipeline Components:**
  - Preprocessor
  - Interaction feature generator
  - Feature scaler
  - The model itself

All preprocessing steps used during training are replicated exactly during inference.

# Application Interface

The deployed application is built using **Streamlit** and provides:

- A **sidebar-based input form** for all model features
- A **main results panel** displaying:
  - Predicted exam score
  - Performance category
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Interpretation guidance
- An **Explore Data** section with interactive visualizations to examine feature relationships

The interface is styled using a **dark theme** and organized as a dashboard for clarity and usability.

# Installation and Deployment

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment(Not required, but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```
#### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should start locally and be available at:
```bash
http://localhost:8501
```

# How to use the Deployed Model

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Use the **sidebar** to enter student information:
    - Numeric inputs (e.g., study hours, sleep hours)
    - Categorical inputs (e.g., course, study method)
3. Click **"Prediction exam score"**.
4. View the results in the main panel:
    - Predicted exam score (%)
    - Performance classification
    - Visual progress indicator
